## Inspiration
Sometimes its hard to know where your friends are as everyone is moving around and due to fear of missing out. Whether it be studying on campus or meeting up at a park, its nice to tell your friends where you are at. You might be wondering, isn't this just SnapChat? Well, you don't share your information 24/7. It's super simple, so even your parents can use it. Also, no one uses SnapChat anymore.

## What it does
It allows people to subscribe to other people's locations or specific location. If someone updates their location, people who are subscribed to that person will receive a text notification. Subscribing must be agreed upon by both parties. In addition, you can also subscribe to locations. If someone enters the location you are subscribed to, you will also receive a notification.
